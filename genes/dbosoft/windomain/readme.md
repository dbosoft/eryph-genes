# Versioning

This geneset contains only fodder genes and is versioned with a major-minor version scheme.  

There is no patch version - when a bug is fixed, a new minor version will be released.  
A new major version is released when a gene is removed from the geneset. 

The tag latest is updated with each released version. If you want to have a stable reference, don't use the latest tag, use a specific version tag.
