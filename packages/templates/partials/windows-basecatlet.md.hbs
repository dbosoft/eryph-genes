# {{ manifest.short_description }}

This geneset contains the base catlet for {{ manifest.short_description }}.

## Usage

The base catlet can be used as parent catlet like this

``` ps
New-Catlet -Parent "{{ geneset }}"
```

This base catlet does not include a default user.  
You should therefore set up your own fodder to create an initial local user or to automatically join a domain.  

Alternatively, you can use the Starter Catlet, which creates a default admin user with an initial password of "InitialPassw0rd".


``` ps
New-Catlet -Parent "{{ geneset }}/starter"
```


See also [starter-food](/b/dbosoft/starter-food) for other defaults and variables for starter food. 
  


## Windows license

All base catlets from dbosoft contain no valid windows license and are build using a evaluation image.  
This means that the license will expire after some time since the initial build and will need to be rearmed (see also [here](https://sid-500.com/2017/08/08/windows-server-2016-evaluation-how-to-extend-the-trial-period/)).

If the catlet can access the Internet at startup, the automatic activation will be activated for 90-180 days (depending on the Windows version).  
  
&nbsp;  
Legal note: By activating the Windows license, you also accept the Windows evaluation license.   
&nbsp;  
  
**You should not use the windows base catlets in production.**
&nbsp;  

Instead, it is recommended that you create your own base catlet that contains or activates your own license.

You can use the [eryph-org/basecatlets-hyperv](https://github.com/eryph-org/basecatlets-hyperv) project as a starting point for your own base catlets and customizations.
