# General Information

## RHEL-Compatible Catlets Naming Convention

The naming convention for the RHEL-compatible server catlets is as follows:

`almalinux-<version>`, `oracle-<version>`, `rhel-<version>`

where `<version>` is the major version number, e.g. `8`, `9`, `10`.
We focus on current and supported enterprise Linux versions.

## Available Distributions

### AlmaLinux
- **Binary compatible** with RHEL
- **Free and open source** - No subscription required
- **Enterprise-focused** with backing from CloudLinux

- **UEK kernel** (Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel) - Optimized for performance

## Monthly Builds

We **plan** to build the server catlets monthly. The build date is part of the tag name.
The tag `latest` is updated with each released version.

Currently the builds have to be triggered manually. We are working on automating this process.
