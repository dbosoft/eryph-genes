# Versioning

This geneset contains 2 kinds of tags:

- Base catlets  
  Base catlets are versioned by a timestamp which is the build date of the catlet.  
  The tag latest is updated with each released version. 

- Starter catlets  
  Starter catlets are versioned with a major-minor version scheme.

  The started catlets are very light and contain only reference to the base catlet and the starter food.
