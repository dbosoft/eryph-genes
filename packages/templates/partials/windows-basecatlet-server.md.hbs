# General Information

## Server Catlets Naming Convention

The naming convention for the server catlets is as follows:

`winsrv<version>-<edition>`
  
&nbsp;  

where

- `<version>` is the Windows version, e.g. `2022` or `2025`
- `<edition>` is the Windows edition, e.g. `standard`, `datacenter`, `standardcore`, `datacentercore`


We currently only build the `standard` and `standardcore` editions regularly. Some genesets also have a `datacenter` edition. 


## Monthly Builds

We **plan** to build the server catlets monthly. The build date is part of the tag name.
The tag `latest` is updated with each released version.  

Currently the builds have to be triggered manually. We are working on automating this process.
