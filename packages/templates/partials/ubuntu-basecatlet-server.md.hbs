## Ubuntu Catlets Naming Convention

The naming convention for the server catlets is as follows:

`ubuntu-<version>`

where `<version>` is the Ubuntu version, e.g. `22.04`.  
We only build long-term support (LTS) versions of Ubuntu.    

## Monthly Builds

We **plan** to build the server catlets monthly. The build date is part of the tag name.
The tag `latest` is updated with each released version.  

Currently the builds have to be triggered manually. We are working on automating this process.
