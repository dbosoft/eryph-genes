# {{ manifest.short_description }}

This geneset contains the base catlet for {{ manifest.short_description }}.

## Usage

The base catlet can be used as parent catlet like this

``` ps
New-Catlet -Parent "{{ geneset }}"
```

This base catlet does not include a default user.  
You should therefore set up your own fodder to create an initial local user or to automatically join a domain.  

Alternatively, you can use the Starter Catlet, which creates a default admin user with an initial password of "admin".


``` ps
New-Catlet -Parent "{{ geneset }}/starter"
```


See also [starter-food](/b/dbosoft/starter-food) for other defaults and variables for starter food.
